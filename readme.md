## 📖 Project Description  
The **Driving School** project consists of a **React.js frontend** and a **.NET 8 Web API backend** designed to manage driving lessons, students, instructors, and scheduling. The frontend provides an interactive interface for users to book lessons, track progress, manage profiles, and process payments. The backend handles all business logic, database interactions, and authentication.

- Use **Bootstrap** for responsive and modern UI components.  
- Communicate with the backend using **REST API**.  
- Implement authentication and role-based access with **JWT tokens**.  
- Provide a **user-friendly dashboard** for students, instructors, and admins.
